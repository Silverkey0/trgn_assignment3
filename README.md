# ensg2hugo.py

## USAGE
python3 ensg2hugo.py [-f][0-9] [file]

## DESCRIPTION
Use ensg2hugo.py to read the Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf to create a dictionary, and lookup the Ensembl name and replace it with the HUGO name.
To get Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf, download the file below and unzip it.
```
curl ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz -O / --remote-name
```

## KNOWN ISSUES
Though ensg2hugo.py can successfully lookup the Ensembl name and replace it with the HUGO name, when I redirect the result into expression_analysis.hugo.tsv, the first line disappear.
